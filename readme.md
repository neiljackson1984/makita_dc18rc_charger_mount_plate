This is an adapter plate that allows the Makita DC18RC battery charger to be permanently mounted to a wall. The plate is fastened to the charger by means of 4 M5 x 16mm pan-head machine screws. Poke a hole in the bottom of each of the four rubber plugs on the bottom of the charger. Then, drive the M5 screws into the hole in the rubber plug (it's a tight fit -- you have to push hard while screwing in the M5 screw). The M5 screw squeezes the rubber plug against the inner wall of the pocket in which the rubber plug sits; the friction between the rubber plug and the inner wall of the pocket holds the plug and the screw in place.

The plate is fastened to the wall by means of four #8 wood screws, or similar. The hole pattern for the holes that connect the plate to the wall is rectangular: 160mm x 180mm .

Note that the hole pattern on the charger is not quite rectangular -- one of the four holes lies a bit off of the vertex of the rectangle defined by the other three holes.
